##Analysis of Authorship in Arabic sources
Verifying authorship in literary texts has long been a challenging task, particularly in languages such as Arabic, which are rich in stylistic variation and historical depth.
This project presents a novel application of the Deep Impostors methodology to the problem of authorship verification in Arabic literature. Inspired by the work of Volkovich and Avros on Shakespearean texts, we adapted this approach to the unique characteristics of classical Arabic, leveraging deep learning techniques to model stylistic fingerprints of authors.

The methodology involves:
Generating embeddings from selected Arabic texts using models such as AraBERT.
Applying impostor-based decision mechanisms to determine the authenticity of authorship.
Distinguishing between genuine and disputed works attributed to a given author using a data-driven approach, replacing traditional purely philological analysis.

Features
✅ Deep learning-based stylistic feature extraction using AraBERT
✅ Impostor-based authorship decision methodology
✅ Focus on classical Arabic literature
✅ Data-driven validation of disputed works
✅ Modular, extensible architecture for additional authors and datasets
